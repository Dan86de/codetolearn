# Third post!

## This is some second header.

I don't remember when it was exactly. What I know is that me and my brother were sitting together in front of the TV watching next episode of _Captain Tsubasa_ or other "cool series in that time". In meantime my father came back from work and brought new Commodore64. How happy we were by opening and starting our first games on this stuff. I remember it took us a loong time to figure out how to connect computer to TV and start using this.
