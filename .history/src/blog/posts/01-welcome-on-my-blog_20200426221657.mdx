# Welcome to my blog! Let me tell You about my Journey!

## This is some header.

I don't remember when it was exactly. What I know is that me and my brother were sitting together in front of the TV watching next episode of _Captain Tsubasa_ or other "cool series in that time". In meantime my father came back from work and brought new **Commodore64**. How happy we were by opening and starting our first games on this stuff. I remember it took us a loong time to figure out how to connect computer to TV and start using this.
